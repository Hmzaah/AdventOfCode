# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a series of programming puzzles released daily in December.

## Development Workflow

- **First Two Weeks**: Implemented using Google Colab.  
- **Subsequent Weeks**: Solutions migrated to VS Code for local development.

## Repository Structure

- Each day's puzzle has its own folder containing:
  - The problem statement (`README.md` or a link to the official site)
  - Python scripts with solutions
  - Sample inputs and outputs for testing

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hmzaah/AdventOfCode.git
